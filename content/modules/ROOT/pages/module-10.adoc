= Exploring etcd snapshots with koff
:prewrap!:

We have looked at `etcd` performance and how critical it is to cluster health, but what if we want to see what's in `etcd`? 

If you have existing `etcd` backups / snapshots or want to take one now, there is a lot you can do and look at!

If you deleted someone important and want to get it back, you can get it from a backup and recreate it in your cluster.

If your `etcd` database is huge, you can parse through a fresh snapshot and see where the issues are without touching production.

Accessing and parsing your `etcd` data isn't a daily occurance, but when the time comes, it's incredibly useful.

In this module we will utilize the `koff` tool to showcase get and inspect commnads on both standard `Kubernetes` objects types as well as traditionally stored `etcd` keys.
